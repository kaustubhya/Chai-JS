We will study about setTimeout() and setInterval() in this lecture.

Syntax:

`setTimeout(handler, timeout)`

eg. `setTimeout(function() {}, 2000)`

timeout = 2 seconds

handler : It is a type of function (callback) in setTimeout() which does not have a name.

timeout is a number in milliseconds

Basically setTimeout() does the work once after waiting for x time period.

Whereas setInterval() keeps repeating the work again and again after x time interval.
It does the work, waits for x time and does the work again and this keeps going on and on.
