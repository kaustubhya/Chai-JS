// APIs earlier came in the format of XML which was difficult to undestand.

// Nowadays, APIs are coming in the format of JSON which is much easier to understand.

// JSON => JavaScript Object Notation

// JSON are objects only with some differences:

// 1. JSON objects donot have a name.
// 2. In JSON, keys and values both are strings.

// eg.

// {
//   "name" : "Hero",
//   "age" : 25,
//   "isBoy": true,
//   "job" : "Doctor"
// }

// Here Numbers and Boolean Datatype values need not be in quotes.

// See one Api here: "https://api.github.com/users/kaustubhya"

// Sometimes APIs come in the form of Array  of Objects:

// eg.

// [
//   {},
//   {},
//   {},
//   {}
// ]

// See this Api: "https://randomuser.me/api/"

// Now sometimes APIs can be difficult, to understand because of their compact form, for this, go to this site: "https://jsonformatter.org/".

// Paste your APIs here and you will have an ease in understanding them, be it in code form or in tree form or in any other form that this site offers.
